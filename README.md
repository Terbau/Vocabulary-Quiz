# Vocabulary-Quiz
Simple script I made to help me study and improve my vocabulary in German.

# Commands
These are commands that you can write at any time during a quiz:
- `ss` or `skip` - Skips the current word.
- `saveas {name}` - Saves your progress so that you can keep on going another time. Note that the file will be saved as `xx-inprogress-{name}.json`.
