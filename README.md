# Vocabulary-Quiz
Simple script I made to help me study and improve my german vocabulary. The folder `words` includes all the files I created during my duolingo run. If you consider using this script, you should definitely create your own vocabulary files as the existing ones are personalized to me specifically. 

# How to create your own vocabulary files
Run `main.py` and just follow the instructions for creating new files. It really is simple as long as you don't create the files manually. Use the script for all its worth.

# Quiz Commands
These are commands that you can write at any time during a quiz:
- `ss` or `skip` - Skips the current word.
- `saveas {name}` - Saves your progress so that you can keep on going another time. Note that the file will be saved as `xx-inprogress-{name}.json`.
